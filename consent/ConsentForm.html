        You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by Itzhak Rasooly in conjunction
        with the Centre for Experimental Social Sciences (CESS). The study has received ethics approval from
        the independent review boards of both the University of Oxford and CESS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before deciding whether to participate in the study, we ask that you carefully read the information below.
        If you decide you do not want to participate, you may leave at any time without providing a reason and without
        penalty. If you choose to leave before the completion of the experiment, your data will not be stored for later
        use.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>The Experiment:</strong> The purpose of this study is to better understand how individuals bid in auctions. As a result,
        you will be asked to bid in a series of auctions against your fellow experimental participants. You will also be asked to complete two further
        tasks to give us a better understanding of how you approach economic decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Participation:</strong> The experiment is expected to take around 40 minutes and you will be paid your earnings through PayPal
        within two weeks of the experiment’s conclusion. While you will be paid at least £2, you can earn
        considerably more if you bid well in the auctions (participants historically earn £10 on average). Please note that you will not receive any compensation if you choose to leave the
        study early.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Data Protection and Privacy:</strong> We will not record your name at any point in the study. Accordingly, it is highly
        unlikely that anyone will be able to personally identify you using the data that you generate. While
        we will ask you a small number of demographic questions at the start of the study (e.g. age and gender), we will
        delete all answers to these questions before sharing the data with any other researchers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Additional Information:</strong> If you are interested in receiving additional information about the results of the study,
        please contact itzhak.rasooly@economics.ox.ac.uk or cess-online@nuffield.ox.ac.uk. Itzhak will do his best to
        provide a summary of the results within twelve months of the conclusion of the experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Concerns:</strong> If you have any questions or concerns about any aspect of this project, you can contact the primary
        investigator Itzhak Rasooly (itzhak.rasooly@economics.ox.ac.uk) or CESS (cess-online@nuffield.ox.ac.uk), who will do their
        best to answer your query. You should receive a response within 10 working days along with an indication of how your response
        will be addressed. If you do not receive a response, or are dissatisfied
        with the response you receive, please contact
        the Social Sciences & Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford:
