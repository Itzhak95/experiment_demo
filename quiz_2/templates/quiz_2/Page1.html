    <p>
        You and another player are playing a game in which each player requests a number of tokens. The amount that you request
        must be a (whole) number between 11 and 20 inclusive. You will receive whatever number of tokens that you request: for example,
        if you request the number {{ x }}, you will be paid {{ x }} tokens. In addition,
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you request exactly one token fewer than your opponent does, you receive a bonus of 20 tokens.</li>
        <li>If you request the same number of tokens as your opponent does, you receive a bonus of 10 tokens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your opponent is playing the same game as you and has received the exact same instructions. So for example, they
        will receive a bonus of 20 tokens if they request one fewer token than you do.
