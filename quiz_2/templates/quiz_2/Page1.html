    <p>
    You and another player must each choose a (whole) number between 11 and 20 inclusive.  You will be paid (in tokens)
    whatever number you choose multiplied by 10. For example, if you choose the number {{ x }}, you will be paid {{ y }} tokens.
    In addition,
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the number you choose is exactly one lower than the number chosen by your opponent, you receive a bonus of 200 tokens.</li>
        <li>If the number you choose is the same as the number chosen by your opponent, you receive a bonus of 100 tokens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Your opponent is playing the same game as you and has received the exact same instructions. So for example, they
    will receive a bonus of 200 tokens if their number is exactly 1 lower than yours.
