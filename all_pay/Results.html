                Congratulations, you won the auction! You receive your valuation of {{ player.value }} minus your bid of
                {{ player.bid }},
                or {{ player.payoff }} in total. As a result, your total balance increases from {{ previous_tokens }} to
                {{ tokens_so_far }}.
            {{ else }}
                You won the auction and receive your valuation of {{ player.value }}. However, you also need to pay your
                bid of {{ player.bid }}.
                As a result, you
                {{ if player.value == player.bid }}
                    don't gain or lose any tokens on net; and your total balance remains at {{ tokens_so_far }}.
                {{ else }}
                    lose {{ payoff_abs }} on net, reducing your total balance from {{ previous_tokens }} to
                    {{ tokens_so_far }}.
                {{ endif }}
            {{ endif }}
        {{ else }}
            Unfortunately, you did not win the auction this round.
            {{ if player.bid > 0 }}
                However, you still need to pay your bid, so lose {{ payoff_abs }}.
                As a result, your total balance falls from {{ previous_tokens }} to {{ tokens_so_far }}.
            {{ else }}
                Since you did not bid any tokens, you do not lose (or gain)
                any tokens; and your balance remains at {{ tokens_so_far }}.
            {{ endif }}
        {{ endif }}
