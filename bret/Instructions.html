        On the next screen, you will see 64 boxes (arranged in a 8x8 table). Behind one of these boxes, a bomb is hidden; the remaining 99 boxes are empty. You do not know where the bomb is. You only know that it can be in any of the boxes with equal probability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to choose how many boxes to collect. Assuming that you donâ€™t collect the bomb, you will earn one token for every box that you collect. However, if you do collect the bomb, your total earnings will be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        To select a box, just click on it. Once you have finished collecting boxes, click 'stop' and then 'solve'.
