        On the next screen, you will see 64 boxes (arranged in a 8x8 table). Inside one of these boxes, a bomb is hidden; the remaining 63 boxes are empty. You do not know where the bomb is. You only know that it can be in any of the boxes with equal probability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to choose how many boxes to collect. Assuming that you donâ€™t collect the bomb, you will earn one token for every box that you collect. However, if you do collect the bomb, your total earnings will be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Observe that the more boxes you collect, the more likely you are to collect the bomb (which destroys your winnings). However, collecting more boxes means that you will get more tokens if you are lucky enough to avoid the bomb.
