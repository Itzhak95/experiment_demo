    <p>
        It is now time to conduct our first auction! The way in which this will work is as follows. First of all, we
        will determine the number of tokens that you will receive if you win the auction (your 'valuation'
        for the imaginary object on sale). To do this, we will randomly choose a whole number
        from 0 to {{ Constants.max_value }}; and any of the possible numbers (0, 1, 2, â€¦, {{ Constants.max_value }})
        are equally likely to be chosen.
