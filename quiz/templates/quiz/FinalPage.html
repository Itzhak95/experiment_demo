    <p>
    Itâ€™s now time to bid in some auctions!
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next page, we will ask you how many tokens you would hypothetically want to bid given various possible
        valuations that you could have. It is important that you answer accurately since one of the valuations below
        will be your actual valuation -- and you will be committed to submitting the corresponding bid that you have
        entered below. For example, if you say that you would want to bid {{ bid }} if your valuation were {{ value }},
        and your valuation turns out to be {{ value }}, then {{ bid }} would be your actual bid.
