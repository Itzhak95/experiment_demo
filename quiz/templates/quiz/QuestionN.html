        Suppose that your valuation is <span id="ego_v">{{ q.ego_v }}</span> and that you choose to
        bid <span id="ego_b">{{ q.ego_b }}</span>. Suppose further that your opponent’s valuation
        is <span id="alter_v">{{ q.alter_v }}</span> and that they bid <span id="alter_b">{{ q.alter_b }}</span>.
