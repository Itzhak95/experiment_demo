    Summary of the auction rules:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>You and your opponent both have a valuation between 0 and 100 (all numbers equally likely).</li>
    <li>You bid knowing your valuation but not that of your opponent.
    <li>You win the auction if you either bid more than your opponent does or if your opponentâ€™s bid is cancelled
     (which happens 50% of the time).
    <li>If you win the auction, you receive your valuation minus the number of tokens that you bid.
</ol>
