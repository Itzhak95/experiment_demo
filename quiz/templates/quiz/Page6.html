    <p>
        To summarise:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You and your opponent both have a valuation between 0 and {{ Constants.max_value }} (all numbers equally likely).</li>
        <li>You bid knowing your valuation but not that of your opponent.{% if bid_step == 5 %} You are allowed to bid any multiple of 5 between 0 and 100. {% else %} {% endif %} </li>
        <li>You win the auction if you either bid more than your opponent does or if your opponentâ€™s bid is cancelled
            (which happens 50% of the time).</li>
        <li>If you win the auction, you receive your valuation minus the number of tokens that you bid.</li>
    </ol>
