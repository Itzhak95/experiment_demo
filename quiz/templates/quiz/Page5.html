    <p>
        If you win the auction, you receive your valuation but have to pay your bid. Hence, what you win overall is
        your valuation minus your bid. For example, if your valuation is {{ value }} tokens, and you bid {{ bid }} tokens, then you
        receive {{ value }} – {{ bid }} = {{ net }} tokens if you win the auction. If you lose the auction, then you don’t gain (or lose) any
        tokens in that round.
