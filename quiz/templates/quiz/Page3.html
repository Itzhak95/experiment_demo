    <p>
        Once you know your valuation (i.e. how many tokens you will receive if you win the auction), you need to decide
        how much to bid.
        {% if bid_step == 1 %}
        You are free to bid any whole number from 0 to {{ Constants.max_value }} (bidding decimal numbers like 3.5 is not allowed).
        Meanwhile, your opponent will have learnt their valuation, and will decide what bid they want to submit.
        {% else %}
        You are free to bid any multiple of five between 0 and 100 inclusive. In other words, you are allowed to bid any of the numbers: 0, 5, 10, â€¦, 95, 100.
        Meanwhile, your opponent will have learnt their valuation, and will decide what multiple of 5 they want to bid.
        {% endif %}
