    Notice that there are {{ if num_bidders == 2 }}two {{ else }}three {{ endif }}important differences from the auction before:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> There is no longer a possibility that bids are cancelled.</li>
        {{ if num_bidders > 2 }} <li> You will now bid against three opponents. </li> {{ else }}{{ endif }}
        <li> The loser now also pays their bid.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Otherwise, the auction rules are exactly the same.
