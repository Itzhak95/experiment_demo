        Summary of the auction rules:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You and your opponent both have a valuation between 0 and 100 (all numbers equally likely).</li>
        <li>You bid knowing your valuation but not that of your opponent.</li>
        <li>You win the auction if you bid strictly more than your opponent does.</li>
        <li>If you win the auction, you receive your valuation minus the number of tokens that you bid.</li>
        <li> However, if you lose the auction, you still need to pay your bid.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
