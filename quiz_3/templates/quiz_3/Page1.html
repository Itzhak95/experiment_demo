    <p>
        It is now time for you to participate in your second type of auction. While the rules are similar to those before,
        there are a few important differences. As before, we will determine your valuation by randomly choosing a whole
        number from 0 to 100 and any of the possible numbers (0, 1, 2, â€¦, 100) are equally likely to be chosen. We
        will do the same for {{ if num_bidders == 2 }} your opponent{{ else }} your three opponents{{ endif }}.
        Once you have learnt your valuation, you must then decide how much to bid and can choose any {{ if bid_step == 1 }}
        whole number {{ else }} multiple of 5 {{ endif }}between 0 and 100. The winner of the auction is the person who bids the most.
        However, {{ if num_bidders == 2 }}both {{ else }}all {{ endif }}of you will now have to pay your bids, including
        the losing bidder{{ if num_bidders > 2 }}s{{ else }}{{ endif }}.
