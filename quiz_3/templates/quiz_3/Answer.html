        What is the chance that your opponent’s valuation is any given number between 0 and 100? For example, what
        is the chance that your opponent’s valuation is 53?
    </p>
    <p style="color:blue">
        Answer: Since their valuation is equally likely to be any whole number between 0 and 100, and there are 101
        such numbers, the chance is 1/101 (roughly 1%).
